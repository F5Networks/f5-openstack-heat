F5 Networks OpenStack Heat Template Library
===========================================

Introduction
------------
OpenStack Heat templates for applications stacks that include F5 BigIP
configurations and templates for deploying F5 VE in an OpenStack cloud.

The two top level directories that exist in this repo which contain Heat
templates are :code:`f5_supported` and :code:`unsupported`.

F5 Supported Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :code:`f5_supported` directory contains templates that are officially supported
by F5 Networks for customers with a support contract.  Users who require
support should contact F5 Support through usual means.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   templates/f5_supported/templates

Unsupported Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :code:`unsupported` directory contains templates that are experimental and should
be used **AT YOUR OWN RISK**.  These templates may have been contributed by
other users or are under development by F5.  Regardless of a customer's status
of a valid support contract, F5 will not support templates that are in this
directory.
