# Test specific variables

# To run the functional tests, there are some gritty details we must get
# past. Here they are:
#   1. The zipped qcow images must be available from a public HTTP location
#   2. To run the clustering test, you must first have booted two bigips
#      that are ready for clustering, meaning you should have a single
#      patch image in Glance. To do this, I suggest you launch the 
#      f5_ve_two_resource_group.yaml template from f5_supported/ve/cluster
#      before running the functional tests
#   3. The above could all be orchestrated, but the stack create time would be
#      approximately 20 minutes long.
#   4. Booting standalone bigip images requires images to be accessible
#      in Glance. This means that order matters in running the tests.
#      You can get these to run by including the 'teardown_glance_images'
#      key in your test environment file (this file) and set its value to
#      True.
#   5. To launch the f5_supported/f5_plugins/deploy_lb.yaml template, you
#      must also have a bigip launched and ready.
