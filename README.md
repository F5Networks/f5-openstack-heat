# f5-openstack-heat
Heat templates for F5 OpenStack deployments

Across all branches in this repository, two directories should exist. The *f5_supported* and *unsupported* directories describe the sets of templates each contains. The *f5_supported* directory contains templates that are officially supported by F5 Networks. The *unsupported* directory contains templates that are experimental. Use unsupported templates **AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
