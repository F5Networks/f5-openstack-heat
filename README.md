# f5-openstack-heat

## Introduction
This repo houses Heat templates that can be used to orchestrate BIG-IP services in an OpenStack (or other Heat-compatible) environment.

**IMPORTANT:** 
Across all branches in this repository, two directories should exist. The *f5_supported* and *unsupported* directories describe the sets of templates each contains. The *f5_supported* directory contains templates that are officially supported by F5 Networks. The *unsupported* directory contains templates that are experimental. Use unsupported templates **AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
